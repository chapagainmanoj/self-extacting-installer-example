# self-extacting-installer-example
An example for self-extracting installer

Normally, we use a package manager for installing, updating and removing packages. They automate the process of downloading, extracting and verifying the package. However, they are not the only way of managing the installation. Adding a binary payload or an archive file to a shell script is one way to distribute the package. The self-extracting installer extracts that payload and copies content to the appropriate location.
